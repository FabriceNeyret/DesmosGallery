# DesmosGallery
An html gallery export button for www.desmos.com using TamperMonkey / GreaseMonkey / etc.
Creates and opens it in a new browser tab, that you can copy on your web page, email, document, or anything where web content can be copy-pasted.

# Usage
Navigate to the main calculator page of Desmos.com, wait for the button "Get Gallery" to appear in the top-right corner of the page. If it is disabled, you should just need to update the view e.g. by dragging it a bit with the mouse. Click on the button to display a new tab containing your personnal gallery of graphs. Save it to your website, or copy-paste it as any web content.

# Installation
Once you have installed TamperMonkey/GreaseMonkey/variant plugin in your favorite browser, then it's as for any script: click on the name.user.js file above, then "raw". Tampermonkey should then directly propose to install the script, otherwise click on your Monkey plugin icon shortcut and manually copy-paste the code as a new script.

# Final note
It is my first script ever :-D ( I followed the model of DesmosToSVG ) , tested only on Chrome and Firefox. 
I hope all will go well !
